BENEFITS OF SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY
-------------------------------------

1. CLARITY & SIMPLIFICATION :
> Classes with a single responsibility are easier to understand and implement.
> Simplifies code, reducing bugs and accelerating development.

2. ERROR SPOTTING :
> Facilitates quick identification of errors within a specific class.
> Streamlines debugging by pinpointing the responsible code.

3. SEPARATION OF CONCERNS :
> Ensures each class has a distinct responsibility, promoting maintainability.
> Facilitates clear separation of functionalities.

4. CODE READABILITY
> Enhances code readability by assigning a single responsibility to each class.
> Reduces time spent searching for relevant code segments.

5. TESTABILITY
6. EFFICIENT CODE CHANGES
7. CODE REUSABILITY
